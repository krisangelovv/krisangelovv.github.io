        <h3>Kaelith, the Forsaken Sentinel</h3>
        <p>Once a loyal guardian of the Sunkeep, Kaelith was betrayed by his order and left to die in the Abyssal Ruins. Now, clad in broken yet enchanted golden armor, his sword pulses with the cursed light of the fallen sun. His oath remains shattered, yet he fights for redemption.</p>

        <h3>Nyssa, the Whispering Veil</h3>
        <p>A mysterious assassin from the Moonshadow Syndicate, Nyssa moves like a living shadow. She wields twin cursed daggers that feed on fear, allowing her to phase between realms for a short time. Despite her cold demeanor, she seeks vengeance for her fallen kin.</p>

        <h3>Vorrak, the Hollowed Tyrant</h3>
        <p>Once a ruthless warlord, Vorrak was cursed by an ancient dragon after consuming its heart. Now part-man, part-draconic beast, he roams the world with smoldering scales and a voice that shakes the earth. Though his body decays with every battle, he seeks an end worthy of his monstrous legacy.</p>
